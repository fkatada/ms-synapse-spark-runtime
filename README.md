# Synapse Spark Runtimes - Release Notes

Apache Spark pools in Azure Synapse use runtimes to tie together essential component versions such as Azure Synapse optimizations, packages, and connectors with a specific Apache Spark version. Each runtime will be upgraded periodically to include new improvements, features, and patches. When you create a serverless Apache Spark pool, you will have the option to select the corresponding Apache Spark version. Based on this, the pool will come pre-installed with the associated runtime components and packages. Azure Synapse Analytics supports multiple runtimes for Apache Spark.
